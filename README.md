## Homeword 2 Game created using JavaScript

This project was quite difficult for me.

It took a long time to get the buttons to work properly.

The OnClick aspect of the timer also took some time to figure out.

I decided to go with a jeopardy style game that asks but I couldn't figure out how to randomize the questions.

The background of the game reflects the type of game that I decided to go with.

I also had to create a border with a background with some opacity due to the background that I selected having so many different colors.

I tried multiple times to get the math.random function to work, but I couldn't get the game to not end once it reached the last question of the array.
So if the code reached the final array before the rest of the questions the game would end. I could not figure out how to make the random loop through the whole
array.
